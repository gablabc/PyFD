# ðŸ§  Tutorials

This is a series of tutorials meant to explain the principles behind the `PyFD` package, its workflow, and its API.
It consists of four series of jupyter notebooks.

## 1 Introduction
These notebooks introduce the general workflow of the `PyFD` package : computing functional decomposition, aggregating them to
get PDP/SHAP/PFI additive explanations, increase their alignment with feature grouping and FD-Trees.
- [1-1-PyFD-Introduction](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/1-1-PyFD-Introduction.ipynb) illustrates the package on a toy dataset and model.
- [1-2-Regression-Introduction](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/1-2-Regression-Introduction.ipynb) applies `PyFD` on a regression use-case (bike rental forecasting).
- [1-3-Classification-Introduction](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/1-3-Classification-Introduction.ipynb) employs the package on a classification scenario (marketing phone call successes).

## 2 Explaining Additive Models
The fundamental goal of `PyFD` is to compute faithful explanations for the predictions of complex black-box models. Yet there is no agreement on what faithful explanations
should look like when investigating general models. Consequently, we argue that it is best to first study models that can be faithfully explained : **Additive Models**. 
This series of tutorials show how to fit and interpret additive models. 

- [2-1-Explain-Linear-Models](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/2-1-Explain-Linear-Models.ipynb) discusses how to explain the predictions of linear models, 
which are the simplest form of additive models.
- [2-2-Explain-Parametric-Additive-Models](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/2-2-Explain-Parametric-Additive-Models.ipynb) introduces parametric additive models and how to explain them.
- [2-3-Explain-NonParametric-Additive-Models](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/2-3-Explain-NonParametric-Additive-Models.ipynb) introduces non-parametric additive models and how to explain them.
- [2-4-Explain-Linear-Categorical-Features](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/2-4-Explain-Linear-Categorical-Features.ipynb) presents how to fit and interpret linear models when features are categorical.

## 3 Explaining General Models 
Once we agree on how additive models should be explained, we can generalize said definitions to more general models by leveraging the theory of **Functional Decomposition**. 
As this suite of tutorials will highlight, Functional Decomposition offers a uniform framework for computing the PDP/SHAP/PFI explainability methods.

## 4 Increasing Explanations Alignment
When explaning models that contain feature interactions (*i.e.* the model is no longer additive), the PDP/SHAP/PFI methods will disagree and potentially lead to contradictory
models insights. Thus, we advocate minimizing the strength of feature interactions to increase the agreement between the various methods. `PyFD` offers two methodologies
to minimize interactions : grouping features and FD-Trees, which are both discussed in the notebook series.

- [4-1-FDTrees](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/4-1-FDTrees.ipynb) introduces FDTrees on the simplest possible example.
- [4-2-FDTrees](https://github.com/gablabc/PyFD/blob/master/tutorials/4-2-FDTrees.ipynb) discusses the mathematics and API of FDTrees in more details.
